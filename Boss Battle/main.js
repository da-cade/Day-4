// TODO Part One
//format page
//format data
//draw two characters
//give them health
//add marquee classes as unique animations (health bars, pointer actions)
//on-click activies - reduces boss's health by 5 -value should stop at 0
  //modify pointer
  //modify selectability of fields
//

// TODO Part Two
// Boss fights back. Hits on an Interval at 3 seconds - damage reduces hero's health by 5
// NOTE STRETCH -- It can be fun to give the boss a bit of variable damage: either use a random number between two values 
  //or for better use in a later step, add an attack property to the boss object.

//TODO Part Three
// Once our boss is defeated, instead of letting them die and locking their health at 0, we want to have the boss "level up".
  // instead double all the values of the boss (health, and if you did attack value)
//NOTE Stretch -- add some fun text, alerts, or indications that show how many monsters have been defeated / what level the monster is on

//TODO Part Four
// Add a value to the monster to represent the 'gold' reward for slaying the monster. 
  //Value should be stored and displayed.

//TODO Part Five
//After a few rounds the hero will lose every time. Add a sort of 'health pack' that the hero can buy with gold
  // this health pack will need to have a specific cost, that the hero can only buy if they have the gold to spend.

//TODO Stretch -- create a companion animal that does additional damage every time the hero attacks. Use a dictionary.
  //Add a button to the page that will allow the user to purchase this companion when they have enough gold. Flips bool val to purchased
  //Next, write a conditional to check if the wolf has been purchased to reduce the extra damage from the boss when the hero attacks.
  //Once you get this working try adding multiple companions to the list for the hero to purchase, mixing up the cost and the damage.
